Tex code for the master thesis at the M2 International Center for Fundamental Physics. This document was written in the context of an internship at Laboratoire Albert Fert (Thales Research & Technology).

Contains a variety of important elements about the study and simulation of photonic systems. 
Corrects a lot of mistakes that can be seen in the study of open bosonic systems. 
Compares different methods of simulation and provides **quantitative metrics** for doing so.
Gives analytical expressions for many important quantities.
Shows that moments can be used to deduce a wide range of quantities in quantum optics.

CODE UNAVAILABE!!!
