    abstract = {The moment generating function of a set of stochastic variables defines the cumulants or the semi-invariants and the cumulant function.  It is possible, simply by formal properties of exponential functions, to generaiize to a great extent the concepts of cumulants and cumulant function.  The stochastic variables to be considered need not be ordinary c -numbers but they may be q -numbers such as used in quantum mechanics.  The exponential function which defines a moment generating function may be any kind of generalized exponential, for example an ordered exponential with a certain prescription for ordering q -number variables.  The definition of average may be greatly generalized as far as the condition is fulfilled that the average of unity is unity.  After statements of a few basic theorems these generalizations are discussed here with certain examples of application.  This generalized cumulant expansion provides us with a point of view from which many existent methods in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics can be unified. }

    abstract = "{A means of unifying some semiclassical models of computational chemistry is presented; these include quantized Hamiltonian dynamics, quantal cumulant dynamics, and semiclassical Moyal dynamics (SMD).  A general method for creating the infinite hierarchy of operator dynamics in the Heisenberg picture is derived together with a general method for truncation (or closure) of that series, and in addition, we provide a simple link to the phase space methods of SMD.  Operator equations of arbitrary order may be created readily, avoiding the tedious algebra identified previously.  Truncation is based on a simple recurrence formula which is related to, but avoids the more complex contractions of, Wick’s theorem.  This generalized method is validated against a number of trial problems considered using the previous methods.  We also touch on some of the limitations involved using such methods, noting, in particular, that any truncation will lead to a state which is in some sense unphysical.  Finally, we briefly introduce our quantum algebra package QuantAL which provides an automated method for the generation of the required equation set, the initial conditions for all variables from any start, and all the higher order approximations necessary for truncation of the series, at essentially arbitrary order. }",

               quantum neural networks, capable of solving hard learning tasks

               approaches with qubits suffer from limited connectivity.  We
               propose an implementation for quantum reservoir that obtains a
               large number of densely connected neurons by using
               parametrically coupled quantum oscillators instead of physically
               coupled qubits.  We analyze a specific hardware implementation
               based on superconducting circuits: with just two coupled quantum
               oscillators, we create a quantum reservoir comprising up to 81
               neurons.  We obtain state-of-the-art accuracy of 99\% on
               benchmark tasks that otherwise require at least 24 classical
               oscillators to be solved.  Our results give the coupling and
               dissipation requirements in the system and show how they affect
               the performance of the quantum reservoir.  Beyond quantum
               reservoir computing, the use of parametrically coupled bosonic
               modes holds promise for realizing large quantum neural network
               architectures, with billions of neurons implemented with only 10

abstract = { The well-known Green’s function method has been recently generalized to nonlinear second-order differential equations.  In this paper, we study possibilities of exact Green’s function solutions of nonlinear differential equations of higher order.  We show that, if the nonlinear term satisfies a generalized homogeneity property, then the nonlinear Green’s function can be represented in terms of the homogeneous solution.  Specific examples and a numerical analysis support the advantage of the method.  We show how, for the Bousinesq and Kortweg–de Vries equations, we are forced to introduce higher order Green’s functions to obtain the solution to the inhomogeneous equation.  The method proves to work also in this case supporting our generalization that yields a closed form solution to a large class of nonlinear differential equations, providing also a formula easily amenable to numerical evaluation.}
