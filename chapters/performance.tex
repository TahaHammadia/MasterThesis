We compare the different methods by estimating their complexities in three different steps: writing the differential equations on scalar functions to solve, solving the differential system and evaluating the moments. We denote $T$ the length of the time interval of interest. Solving the differential equation has a time and memory complexity proportional to $T$. As a reminder, $N$ denotes the number of modes, $p$ the cut-off, $m$ the degree of the Hamiltonian, $w_H$ the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, $w_L$ the number of jump operators,  $M_{\max, i}$ the maximal number of photons for the mode $i$, $\chi$ the number of terms for the sum on Gaussian states, $B_p$ the $p^{\text{th}}$ Bell number, cf.\@~\autoref{bell-append}.

\subsection{Density Matrix Method}
We recall that the space dimension of the density matrix method is given by $\Theta\left(\prod_{i = 1}^N M_{\max, i}\right)$, which is exponential in the number of modes $N$. The three steps require manipulating matrices of size $\Theta\left(\prod_{i = 1}^N M_{\max, i}\right)$ \textit{via} multiplication, addition or inversion. Thus, the time complexity is proportional to a polynomial of $\Theta\left(\prod_{i = 1}^N M_{\max, i}\right)$.

\subsection{Usual MF}
This section refers to the methods \texttt{Divide in half} and \texttt{Minimum Cut}. The number of equations is $\sim \frac{1}{2} \sum_{q=1}^p \binom{2N+q-1}{q} = O((2N)^p)$. By using the bilinearity and product relation for the commutator, we can show that each equation has a time complexity $O((w_H + w_L) (p+m))$, where $w_H$ is the number of monomials in $H$ and $w_L$ is the number of jump operators. The memory complexity is $\sim \frac{1}{2} \sum_{q=1}^p \binom{2N+q-1}{q}$. The expressions can potentially been stored in an optimal manner. Solving the initial value problem requires using linear algebra polynomials, thus its time and memory complexities are given by $\Theta\left(T \text{poly}\left(\sum_{q=1}^p \binom{2N+q-1}{q}\right)\right)$. Retrieving the moments is straightforward since they are the values that are computed by solving the differential system. When the initial state is a sum over $\chi$ Gaussian states, we need to solve for each projector $\frac{\ketbra{\alpha_\xi}{\alpha_\zeta}}{\braket{\alpha_\zeta}{\alpha_\xi}}$ independently, thus leading to a factor $\chi^2$.

\subsection{Cumulant Method}
The cumulant method is similar to the usual MF methods. One important difference is time needed to convert moments to cumulants and vice-versa. This time scales as $B_p$, i.e.\@~the $p^{\text{th}}$ Bell number, see~\autoref{bell-append} for an introduction to Bell numbers. One important point is that $B_p$ grows exponentially with $p$. Writing differential equations on cumulants is usually done by converting differential equations on moments~\cite{khan2021physical}. Thus each term (a moment) needs to be converted into cumulants. For each equation, the number of terms is $O((w_H + w_L) (p+m))$. Furthermore, retrieving a moment requires converting back cumulants into moments, taking  a time proportional to $B_p$.

\subsection{Time Evolution Approximation}

For the TEA, the state is represented by the evolution of the annihilators $a_i(t)$. These states can be represented, up to the time of validity which can be expanded using Pad√© approximate, by the coefficients which can be written symbolically. Thus, their is no need to solve a differential system, solving the problem of stability. Additionally, retrieving a moment requires multiplying symbolic representations, which requires computing $\chi^2$ terms. The main limiting factor of this method is the time needed to compute the commutators. 

The results of this part are summarized in~\autoref{tab:comp-meths-1} and \autoref{tab:comp-meths-2}. Complexities are over-estimated (with $O$) for the sake of making the comparison easier. See \autoref{bell-append} for the asymptotic behavior of Bell numbers.
