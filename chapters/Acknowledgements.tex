I am deeply indebted to the administration of the International Center for Fundamental Physics, in particular to the coordinators of the Master and to Médina Mahrez who plays a key role in the organization of the Master.  I would also to thank the SOIE of Ecole Polytechnique whose administrative work allowed for the required paperwork to be processed smoothly.

This endeavour would have been impossible without the help of my supervisors Dr.\@ Danijela Marković of the CNRS and Dr.\@ Elie Gouzien of Alice \& Bob. Their advice and directions were crucial for developing an understanding of the problem. My internship would not have been a success without their advice and knowledge. I would also like to thank Dr.\@ Yann Beaujeault-Taudiere for suggesting to use the Padé approximant. Thanks should also go to Julien Dudas for their insights on the application side of our project. I am also grateful to the Laboratoire Albert Fert administration, both from the CNRS and Thales side.

I am tremendously grateful to Thales Research and Technology Palaiseau who financed this project and who are a big contributor to the success of the Laboratoire Albert Fert.

Many thanks should go to my parents and family for their unabating support throughout the different stages of my life. Finally, thanks should go to the professors, students and Post-Doctoral Fellows I met during my internship, in particular to Julien Dudas, Théo Malas-Danzé, Julien Berthomier, Baptiste Carles and Clara Zimmermann.
