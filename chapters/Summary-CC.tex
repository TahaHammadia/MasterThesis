We have studied how to solve open bosonic systems when finding exact analytical solutions is challenging, cf.\@~\autoref{app-analytic-exp}. After a brief overview of the literature (cf.\@~\autoref{generalities-chapter}), we showed how to write the quantum Langevin equation for many photon loss (cf.\@~\autoref{find-langevin-gen} and~\autoref{2-langevin}). Afterwards, we present our contribution to MF methods and introduced some tools to compare between them (cf.\@~\autoref{sub-num-stab} and~\autoref{comp-methds})(cf.\@~\autoref{app-squeeze}). We can study dynamics from states that can be expressed as a sum over low-cumulant states.  We also introduce the time evolution approximation (cf.\@~\autoref{meth-tea}) which allows to approximate the finite series of $a_i(t)$. A great care has been taken in comparing quantitatively the different methods and in proving the different statements. Appendices give some clarifications and details that could not be put in the report.

In particular, a summarized comparison between the methods is provided in \autoref{tab:summ-table}. The comparison highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods. A key takeaway is that the choice of the method to apply depends on the particular needs of each case.
